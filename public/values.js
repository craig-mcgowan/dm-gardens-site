      "Minimizing environmental impact is a key part of our approach. Key concepts include minimizing landfill: We take into consideration the waste generated from our projects from start to finish. We use products with less packaging, and recycle and/or reuseleftover packaging when appropriate. When reworking an existing landscape,salvageable plants and materials are often donated. Waste that is compostable is composted. Our fleet of battery-powered equipment can be used in many situations, and theyreduce the emissions and noise that comes with gas engines. As the technology of battery-powered equipment improves, we will continue to make investments in tools that drive productivity and reduce our carbon footprint.",
